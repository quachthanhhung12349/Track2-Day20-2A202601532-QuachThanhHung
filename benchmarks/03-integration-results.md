## Answers returned

**Why is goodput more useful than raw throughput?**

> Goodput@SLO counts only the requests per second that met the TTFT and TPOT targets. Throughput at saturation ignores SLOs.

**What problem does PagedAttention actually solve?**

> PagedAttention stores the KV cache in non-contiguous pages, removing the internal fragmentation that wasted most GPU memory.

**When does splitting prefill and decode help?**

> Splitting prefill and decode helps because prefill is compute-bound and decode is memory-bandwidth-bound.


## Which N16-N19 pieces are real (required -- replace this line)

_List each of N16, N17, N18, N19 as real or stubbed. Stubbing costs no points;
misrepresenting it does. Then answer: is the dominant stage above what you expected?
If you had to halve this pipeline's latency, which stage would you attack and why?_
